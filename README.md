## Hooli-style Popup

[Demo](https://dmytro-botnarenko.github.io/hooli-style-popup)

The practice project for Kottans Frontend learning course.

The popup is expected to have three states depending on user actions:
- initial state: popups are not visible
- after clicking the popup-button, the popup becomes visible or hidden if it is already open
- click the "More" button to add 3 to 10 more icons and make the popup content scrollable

Used only html and css, no js and no libraries/frameworks.
